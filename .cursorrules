This is a React application that demonstrates seam carving.

## Project Structure

- `package.json`: Defines project dependencies and scripts. Uses `react`, `react-dom`, and `esbuild`.
- `public/`: Contains the `index.html` and other static assets.
- `src/`: Contains the React application source code.
  - `index.jsx`: The entry point for the React application. Renders the `App` component.
  - `App.jsx`: The main application component. It manages the state for the selected and uploaded images, and the controls for the seam carving visualization. It uses `ImageSelector`, `ImageUploader`, and `Seam` components.
  - `components/`: Contains reusable React components.
    - `ImageUploader.jsx`: A component for uploading images.
    - `ImageSelector.jsx`: A component for selecting from a list of preset images.
    - `Seam.jsx`: A placeholder component that will eventually implement the seam carving logic. It currently just displays the selected image.
  - `src/`: Contains the React application source code.
    - `index.jsx`: The entry point for the React application. Renders the `App` component.
    - `App.jsx`: The main application component. It manages image state and a single `config` object for all seam carving parameters. It renders the `ImageSelector`, `Controls`, and `Seam` components.
    - `components/`: Contains reusable React components.
      - `Controls.jsx`: A component containing all user controls (sliders, toggles). It is collapsible and manages its own collapsed state.
      - `ImageUploader.jsx`: A component for uploading images.
      - `ImageSelector.jsx`: A component for selecting from a list of preset images.
      - `Seam.jsx`: A placeholder component that displays the image and receives the `config` object.
